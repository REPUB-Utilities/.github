## 👋 We are REPUB Utilities!

We are a tiny group of developers hard at work building new utilities for The Republic - an independent Eve Online alliance. Here you will find our collection of random bits and bobs 🔩 If you find anything useful, steal it and use it for your own purposes.

## 👨‍💻 Developing in the open

Our counterintelligence team might not like it, but we are developing all of our projects in the open. This means that you can follow along with our progress, and even contribute if you want to - but be warned, we will also steal your code and use it for our own purposes 😈

You can see our next projects and features on our [public roadmap]() ✨
